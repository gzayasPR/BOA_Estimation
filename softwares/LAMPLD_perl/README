Documentation of the LAMPLD/PED software package


The LAMPLD/PED software package implements methods for perfoming local ancestry inference in 
multi-way admixed populations (e.g. Latinos, a 3-way admixed populations), described in:
Baran, Pasaniuc, Sankararaman et al. "Fast and accurate inference of local ancestry in 
Latino populations" (Bioinformatics, 2012)

1. BUILDING THE SOURCE CODE

The executable files in the bin directory were built and tested on a Linux 64 bit machine. 
If any of the executables do not run correctly, execute "make clean ; make all ; make install" 
from the main directory.

2. REQUIRED INPUT FILES

<posfile>
	- file containing physical positions of each SNP in the data one SNP per line
	- Example: test_data/chr1.pos

<ancestral haplotype files>
	- file containing ancestral haplotype data one haplotype per line in a 0/1/?/ format, no spaces between alleles
	- 0 denotes reference allele, 1 the alternate allele and '?' missing data; 
	- encoding of reference allele is arbitrary but NEEDS to be consistent across all ancestral reference panels and admixed genotype sample
	- for ensuring encoding consistency we recommend removing A/T and G/C SNPs if Affymetrix genotyping platforms are used
	- one file per each ancestral population is required (e.g. for Latinos one file for each of the African, European, Native American ancestries)
	- WARNING::Number of alleles per haplotype needs to match the number of SNPs in the posfile
	- Example: test/EUR_haps.ref, test/NA_Haps.ref,  test/YRI_haps.ref

<admixed genotype sample>
	- one line per sample in a 0/1/2/? format
	- 0/1/2 denotes number of reference alleles (encoding of allele NEEDS to be consistent in sample and reference panels)
	- ? encodes missing data
	- if file contains trio families then the order of samples in the file is REQUIRED to be Mother/Father/Child

3. OUTPUT FILES

<output of LAMP-LD>
	- contains estimated local ancestries, one diploid sample per line
	- for minimum data storage, encoding of local ancestry for each sample is given only as positions where ancestry changes (breakpoint) together with ancestry before
	- E.g. 02:1000 00:3000 01:40000 11:50000 encodes local ancestry of 0/2 for all SNPs 0-999, 0/0 from SNP 1000-2999, 0/1 from SNP 3000-39999
	- 0-encodes European ancestry, 1- Native American and 2-African
	- to convert from this format into standard format of 2 lines per sample with local ancestry use convertLAMPLDout.pl

<output of LAMP-PED>
	- contains one line per haplotype, 4 lines per trio, Transmitted/Untransmittted/Transmitted/Untransmitted
	- 0/1/2 denotes the ancestry of each allele in each haplotype	
	- 0-encodes European ancestry, 1- Native American and 2-African

4. TEST DATA
	- example input files are provided in the test_data/ directory
	- to run LAMP-PED on test data run:: perl run_LAMPPED.pl test_data/chr1.pos test_data/EUR_haps.ref test_data/NA_haps.ref test_data/YRI_haps.ref test_data/trio.gen test_data/lampped.out
	- to convert LAMP-LD compact format to long format run:: perl convertLAMPLDout.pl test_data/lampld.out test_data/lampld.out.long

5. ADVANCED PARAMETERS
	- we recommend running LAMP-LD/PED separately for each chromosome, each chromosome in its own directory
	- for computational reasons the maximum number of SNPs per chromosome is limited to 50,000
	- we recommend running LAMP-LD/PED in batches of 50 to 100 samples
	- we also recommend running LAMP-LD on nodes with large amounts of memory > 4Gb
	- if program is too slow try reducing the number of states per SNP in the HMM by reducing the parameter 'numStatesHMM' in either run_LAMPPED.pl/run_LAMPLD.pl
6. USE PRE-TRAINED HMMS
       - for scalability when running in parallel you can train the hmm on the reference panels and use the trained hmm in parrallel:
       - WARNING: the number of states and window length need to match!
       Example: 
       step 1: ./trainhmm 50 3 test_data/chr1.pos test_data/EUR_haps.ref test_data/NA_haps.ref test_data/YRI_haps.ref trained.hmm
       step 2: ./unolanc 50 3 test_data/chr1.pos test_data/EUR_haps.ref test_data/NA_haps.ref test_data/YRI_haps.ref test_data/trio.gen trio.localanc trained.hmm
